## hello-world-ios-app
#### An iOS Pre-work project that I made following [CodePath.org](http://codepath.org/)'s tutorials to apply for its 12-week [Mobile App Design](http://codepath.org/classes#fifth-course) online course. 

This iOS app displays "Hello from Cora!" with buttons that allow the user to do the following:
- change the text displayed
- change the text color and revert the change
- change the background screen color
- display text to say goodbye

The user can also tap outside of any button or field to reset the screen to the default settings.
